  We need to protect our privacy, and that's why we're coming together on June 5 to Prague to sit down and discuss different aspects of privacy in the Web3 industry - how we can help shape it and make it more accessible - building a shared culture. The conference complements the research project [Web3Privacy Now](http://web3privacy.info/) and was created by joining forces with the production team of the privacy hackathon [ETHBrno](https://ethbrno.cz/).
